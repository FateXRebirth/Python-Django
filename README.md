# Python-Django

This project aims to learn how to use Django framework as a backend for a web application.

The database is going to use either MySQL or PostgreSQL.

I haven't decided yet to use Client-side render or Server-side render.

I may choose [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) or [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) as frontend framework if I use Client-side render.
